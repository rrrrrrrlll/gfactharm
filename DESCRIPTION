Description: Implements a stepwise procedure for harmonizing psychometric data based on
    assumption of a second order, general factor linear model. The package provides
    tools for Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify structure, Confirmatory
    Factor Analysis (CFA) for validation, Differential Item Functioning (DIF) detection
    to ensure measurement invariance, and data harmonization across multiple groups.
